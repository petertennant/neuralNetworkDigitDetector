trainImprovements.cpp is the code for the training of the network. This program uses the custom dataset of handdrawn drawings which are custom0-28.txt.
10 is the settings for the weights and biases that were determined using trainImprovements.
runningPaintBiggerNum.cpp is the code for the final program where a digit is drawn and the neural network guesses the digit. Note that this program is imcompadable with 
the new termianl in windows 11. The intended use was for the windows 10 terminal and running the program in CodeBlocks. In order to draw in the terminal, quick edit mode must be
turned off and the mouse must be set to scroll instead of edit.
Pressing 'G' in the program will make the neural network guess what the digit is. Pressing 'C' will clear the canvas without guessing the number.
